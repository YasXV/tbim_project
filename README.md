Modeling the segregration phenomena in nanoalloys. Computation of the tight-binding Ising model and the effective pair interactions for binary systems using Monte carlo techniques. Construction of a namespace. Coded in object oriented c++

Nanoalloys are nanoparticles of alloys with at least two different elements and very interesting properties in catalysis, optics and magnetism. Theses properties depend on the chemical arrangement of the two (or more) elements in the nanoparticle and we use Monte Carlo simulations to resolve the optimal configuration, i.e. the one minimizing internal energy.
The purpose of this project is to put light on the segregation phenomena. Indeed when introducing impurities, a preferential position within the mesh can be demonstrated. From a code written in FORTRAN we will compute a new code written in C++.
